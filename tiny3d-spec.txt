Each entity separated by '/'
Each part separated by ','

PARTS:

1 = type: (0 = box, 1 = cylinder, 2 = cone, 3 = plane, 4 = sphere)
    Cylinder: type segmentsRadial
    Cone: type segmentsRadial radiusBottom radiusTop

(TO DO: if radiusBottom == 1 and radiusTop == 0, then we shouldn't need to enter that here)

2 = group colour i (based on materials. Convert group names to numbers) (colour, without #) (i = interact class - only need to add the first time a group appears)

(TO DO: only 3 digits for colour)

3 = position

4 = scale (if 1 value, apply that to all 3 axis)

5 = rotation (optional)
